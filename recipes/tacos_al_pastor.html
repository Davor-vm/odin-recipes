        <li>1 can of sliced pineapple</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized bunch of cilantro, washed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>30g of cleaned and seeded guajillo chilies (about 4 chilies)</li>
        <li>30g of achiote paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of pineapple juice(you can use the juice from the can of the sliced pineapples)</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of or√©gano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to season the meat</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, finelly chopped</li>
        <li>hot-sauce of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chiles in a pot and cover with water. Simmer over medium heat for about 15 minutes, or until tender. Let them cool and then drain the water.</li>
        <li>Place the chiles, vinegar, pineapple juice with the spices, and achiote paste in the blender. Blend until a very smooth sauce forms.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce slowly through a fine sieve to achieve a smooth, even texture. Taste the sauce to ensure it contains enough salt.</li>
        <li>Season the meat with salt and pepper. Place the sauce and the steaks in a large bowl, marinate the meat, or use a pastry brush to apply the sauce to each side of the steaks.</li>
        <li>Marinate for at least 4 hours or leave overnight.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is marinated, cut it in fine strips, remove any excess adobo sauce. </li>
        <li>Heat the pan and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of oil until hot; enough so that when the meat splatters slightly when placed in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and pineapple slices along the sides of the meat to cook. Also, be sure to turn the meat over as needed to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the meat finely and prepare the tacos with onion, cilantro, pineapple and the salsa that you like.</li>
    </ol>
